# PHPWander

This tool is part of my master's thesis and it is still under development.

A lot of the code is inspired by awesome PHPStan ([phpstan/phpstan](https://github.com/phpstan/phpstan/)). Some classes are just copied out and reworked/retyped according to my needs, some just share the structure or name.

Anyway, many thanks to Ondrej Mirtes for his devotion working on PHPStan and you should definitely check it out!  

## Installation

1. Clone this repository
2. Get [composer](https://getcomposer.org/download/)

4. In browser navigate to web root of the repository and ```demo.php``` file (not having HTTP server? Run ```php -S localhost:8081```, then you can visit ```http://localhost:8081/demo.php```)
